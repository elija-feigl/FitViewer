# FitViewer
[FitViewer](https://github.com/elija-feigl/FitViewer) for context based zoning and cropping of cryo-EM maps using pseudoatomic models fitting into cryo-EM electrondensity maps of lattice based DNA origami structures

# Usage
start the interactive Jupyter-Notebook by executing the the following command from the repository directory:
```
jupyter notebook viewertool.ipynb
```
Step by step instructions are provided in the Jupyter notebook 

# Requirements
[FitViewer](https://github.com/elija-feigl/FitViewer) is currently distributed as a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/documentation). It requires an [ipytohn kernel](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) with the follwoing dependencies.
